                            Listening to music has always been my go to activity for all occasions. My love for music
                            can be traced back to when I was a child.
                            There are recorded videos of me as a child becoming hyperactive whenever music was played. I
                            would run to the stereo, turn on the music
                            to full volume and start running around dancing. Anyone who dared touch the sound system
                            would face my wrath. Music was the only thing
                            that could calm me down whenever I cried.
