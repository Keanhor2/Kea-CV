                    <p>I always listening to music because music it helps reduce my stress. I think music as a part of life that helps me happy.
                        Listening to music has always been my go to activity for all occasions. My love for music can be traced back to when I was a child. 
                        There are recorded videos of me as a child becoming hyperactive whenever music was played. I would run to the stereo, turn on the music 
                        to full volume and start running around dancing. Anyone who dared touch the sound system would face my wrath. Music was the only thing
                         that could calm me down whenever I cried.
